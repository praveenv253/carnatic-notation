I would like to have the following capabilities:
- A full class import, which allows you to create a single song in a document:
  Title, composer, ragam, talam, etc. could be options to maketitle and so on
- A package that can be imported separately to just notate pieces of music:
  + For e.g., I want to write swaras in khanda jathi ata talam, tisra nadai.
    I should have an environment with options that lets me do this.
  + I should also be able to do this with swara-sahityam.
  + Options to have swaras upright and sahityam in italics, perhaps
- Some control on spacing (though probably this will have to come later)
  + Should we have a full taalam cycle on one line, or split over two lines, or
    split over three lines? How should they be split, etc.
  + To start with, I won't have end-user control here, and instead just define
    some defaults.
- Simplified definitions for notes in mandra sthayi, tara sthayi, etc.

How do I go about implementing this?
- Option 1: different environments for different talas.
- Option 2: One environment for all talas, but with different options/params
  + This is much more difficult
- However, I definitely do not want to rewrite things for swaram and sahityam.
  + In this regard, it would be nice if swaram/sahityam could be some kind of
    option that can be passed to the environment for the appropriate talam.
- Refer to Tables in LaTeX2e: Packages and Methods, by Lapo Filippo Mori
  (https://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2007-1/mori/mori.pdf).
- Also see the TeX SE question "Which tabular packages do which tasks and which
  packages conflict?" (https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/12672/56690).
- The collcell package appears to be useful to define new columns which apply
  a user-defined macro on each cell
  (http://ctan.imsc.res.in/macros/latex/contrib/collcell/collcell.pdf).

YAML + Python
- I'm starting to strongly feel that trying to write a latex package using
  latex is a bad idea. It doesn't enable easy maintainability, because it's
  such a poor *programming* language.
- Also, expecting someone to contribute latex code for music notation is not
  the greatest idea. Far easier to read and write YAML code.
- It's also easier to mass-convert a lot of existing notation available online
  into YAML, than to latex.
- Finally, YAML can be very easily converted to other formats, including HTML.
- Since we need some scripting language to do the conversions, and Python is
  my favourite language, this is what I'll be using

What does a song look like in yaml?
- I think the basic layout of swara-sahitya should be something like:
  - sw: # Two lines of swaram
    - s r g m p d n s'
    - s' n d p m g r s
  - sa: # Two lines of sahityam
    - sa , ra , , , swa , thi , , ,
    - na , mo , , , sthu , the , , ,
  - swsa: # Alternating swaram and sahityam
    - s , r , , , m , p , , ,
    - sa , ra , , , swa , thi , , ,
    - p m n d p m p , d , , ,
    - na , mo , , , sthu , the , , ,
- How do you add meta-data to this? Suppose all three of the above were to
  appear in the same file one after another, with numbering accordingly? I
  think it would look like this:
  - talam: adi
    nadai: 1  # This unusual nadai is only for sarali varisais
    sw:
    - s r g m p d n s'
    - s' n d p m g r s
  - talam: rupaka
    swsa:
    - s , r , , , m , p , , ,
    - sa , ra , , , swa , thi , , ,
    - p m n d p m p , d , , ,
    - na , mo , , , sthu , the , , ,
- This way, there's nice integration. Metadata formatting is still unclear,
  however. More options may be needed
- How do we set a global context? We need something like CSS, where as things
  get more local, options can basically get overridden
  + First, there's the default config. Once a talam is specified, the talam
    defaults are loaded.
  + Next, there's the file-level config. This is used to update the talam
    defaults. Where do these configs go? Here's one option:
    - defaults:
        talam: rupaka
        nadai: 4
  + In the above method, if a list item contains the defaults key, then all
    other lines in this get ignored.
